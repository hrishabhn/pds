# Exercise 6: Tuples
# - Define a tuple called coordinates with two values representing a point in 2D space (e.g., (x, y)).
# - Print the value of coordinates and access each element by its index.

coordinates = (3, 2)

print('Coordinates:', coordinates)
print('X:', coordinates[0])
print('Y:', coordinates[1])
